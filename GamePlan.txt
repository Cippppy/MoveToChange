The program relies heavily upon the Person class.
This is so the GUI understands what to display for who is logged in.
How does the GUI know what to display?
We're going to have the Person class hold a HashMap with the keys being the Organization and the value being the Role.
Why?
This is so that a person can be a member of multiple organizations each one with a different role.
How do we acheive the different displays?
Basically, the Person instance once fetched from the Login, will be passed from Login into the GUI.
Each GUI panel will have their own class all taking the Person instance as a parameter, so that each panel displays the specific organzations of that person and their unique role options for that organzation.

Here's our plan in terms of the GUI:
The Login will launch itself. It will be the very first thing that appears when we run our program.
When the username and password is entered, the Login will fetch the already declared instance of the Person from our database (file).
It will then pass this instance into the GUI, so that the GUI knows what to display.
If the person wants to create an account, Then the Login will add a new instance of Person to the database with the new credntials.
